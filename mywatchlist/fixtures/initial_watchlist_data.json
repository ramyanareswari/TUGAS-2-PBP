Instead, this belongs to the lexicon of more restrained, realistic and psychological war dramas like “Oslo” (2021) and “The Imitation Game” (2014) where the impact of the war on the protagonists is depicted in fine detail rather than the event itself."

As a history buff it's a good movie that's not overly historical and still has it's good tense scenes. Shows Nazi Germany as it mostly was, not all germans supported the war crimes and crimes against humanity,  alot of regular germans actual wasn't to aware of that part and this movie shows one of the plots to overthrow the axis of evil."
